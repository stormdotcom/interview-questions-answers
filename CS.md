Below is a focused study plan in Markdown format designed to cover core C# and .NET

# C# & .NET Quick Study Plan

**Interview Time:** 10 AM tomorrow  
**Total Study Time:** Approximately 6-8 hours

---

## 1. Environment Setup (15 minutes)

- **Install & Verify:**
  - Confirm VS Code is installed.
  - Install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
  - Verify by running:
    ```bash
    dotnet --version
    ```

---

## 2. C# Core Concepts (1.5 hours)

### a. Basic Syntax & Data Types

- Review variables, data types (int, string, bool, etc.), conditionals, loops.
- **Action:** Write small code snippets to solidify your understanding.

### b. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Classes & Objects:** Understand how to define classes and create instances.
  - **Inheritance:** Learn how derived classes inherit from base classes.
  - **Polymorphism:** Look at method overriding and virtual methods.
  - **Encapsulation:** Understand access modifiers (public, private, etc.).
- **Action:** Create a simple class hierarchy (e.g., a base class `Animal` with derived classes `Dog` and `Cat`).

---

## 3. Advanced Concepts (1 hour)

### a. Dependency Injection (DI)

- **What to Know:**
  - Concept: How DI helps in building loosely coupled applications.
  - Basics of using .NET Core's built-in DI container.
- **Action:**
  - Review a basic DI example:
    ```csharp
    public interface IService { void Serve(); }
    public class Service : IService { public void Serve() { Console.WriteLine("Service Called"); } }
    public class Consumer {
        private readonly IService _service;
        public Consumer(IService service) { _service = service; }
        public void Start() { _service.Serve(); }
    }
    ```
  - Understand how this might be set up in a Console App or ASP.NET Core.

### b. Interfaces & Abstract Classes

- **Differences & Use-Cases:**
  - When to use an interface versus an abstract class.
- **Action:** Write a quick example demonstrating both.

---

## 4. .NET Core Fundamentals (1 hour)

### a. Console Application Structure

- **Review:**
  - `Program.cs` and the structure of a typical console app.
  - Running the app with:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
- **Action:** Create a "Hello World" project:
  ```bash
  dotnet new console -o HelloWorld
  cd HelloWorld
  dotnet run
  ```

### b. Brief Overview of ASP.NET Core (Optional, if role requires)

- **Concepts:**
  - Basic routing and middleware.
  - Controller structure.
- **Action:** Skim through an introductory tutorial if time permits.

---

## 5. Practical Exercises & Coding (1.5 hours)

### a. Build a Sample Console App

- **Objective:** Combine DI and OOP concepts.
- **Steps:**
  1. Create a new console project.
  2. Implement an interface and its class.
  3. Set up dependency injection in a basic way.
  4. Write a method that demonstrates polymorphism.
- **Action:** Code along, then run and test your application.

### b. Debugging and Testing

- **Action:** Practice using breakpoints in VS Code and stepping through your code to understand flow.

---

## 6. Review & Mock Interview (45 minutes)

### a. Recap Key Topics

- OOP principles
- Dependency Injection
- Basic .NET Core application structure

### b. Prepare Answers for Common Questions

- How does C# implement OOP compared to JavaScript/TypeScript?
- Explain dependency injection and its benefits.
- Describe a typical .NET project structure.
- How do you manage asynchronous operations in C# (Task, async/await)?

### c. Quick Q&A Practice

- Discuss your experience transitioning from JS/TS to C#.
- Emphasize your strong problem-solving skills and adaptability.

---

## 7. Final Preparation (15 minutes)

- **Review Notes:** Skim through key points and code examples.
- **Relax:** Take a short walk or practice some deep breathing exercises.
- **Setup:** Ensure your interview space is quiet, and have your notepad with key topics ready.
- **Mindset:** Remind yourself that your strong programming fundamentals and learning ability are valuable assets.
